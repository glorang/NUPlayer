# NUPlayer

This project hosts NUPlayer. An, unofficial, Android TV / Google TV player for VRT.NU content based on the [Leanback library](https://github.com/android/tv-samples) by Google.

# Current status

VRT asked me to take the app offline so I have removed it from Google Play and all binary builds (APK) here on GitHub.

I suggest you uninstall NUPlayer and install [the official VRT.NU app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.vrt.vrtnu) which became available now for Android TV.

It's unclear at the moment what I will do with the NUPlayer project.

Many thanks to all NUPlayer users for all comments, reviews and feedback I received in the past 9 months! :-)
